        <h1>Mindustry HJson Guide</h1>
        <h2>About the guide.</h2>
        <p>
            This guide is not meant to be comprehensive or completely teach you how to create a mod.
            I just created this to fill the gaps that the <a href="https://mindustrygame.github.io/wiki/">Mindustry WIKI</a> dosen't.
            If you would like to contribute you can reach out to me or open a pull request. 
            This guide was only started on 2024 December 2nd so don't expect too much for now.

        <h2>First Time Modding</h2>
        <p>
            Mindustry modding can be either a breeze, or an abosoulute nightmare.
            There are some important things you should know before you create your magnum opus.
        </p>
        <h3>Development Enviornment</h3>
        <p>
            You will need a way to create your code and a way to host it.
            The <a href="/gs/hjson/development-enviornment.html">development enviornment</a> I use is very simple and can be used as long as you have contact to the internet and linux.
        </p>
        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
            If you need help modding you can go to Mindustry's official <a href="https://discord.gg/mindustry">Discord</a>. 
            They have a thriving modding community and channels specifialy for modding.
