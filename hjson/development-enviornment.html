        <h1>Development Enviornment</h1>
        <p>
            Your develpment enviornment is the tools and programs you use to develop. 
            Pretty self explanatory huh?
        </p>
        <h2>My Development Enviornment</h2>
        <p>
            My development enviornment will likely differ from yours. 
            I am constrained by my resorces and I use a chromebook almost exclusively for all the things I do. 
            If you have better hardware than what I have then feel free to experiment.
            Ask other modders what they use. There are multiple ways to skin a cat.
        </p>
        <h3>What I Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Computer</h4>
                <p>
                    I use a Chromebook for all the development I do. Make sure you have a linux chrombook, It will help.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Code Editor</h4>
                <p>
                    For editing code I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code For Web</a>.
                    VSCode is the best code editor I have used. 
                    It can remotely connect to repositories on github and has extensions you can download in the VSCode extension browser.
                    VSCode is also extremly customizeable.
                    Getting VSCode installed on your computer enables many more powerful features.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Code Hosting</h4>
                <p>
                    If you want someone else to be able to play your mod you will need to have a way for them to reliably get your mod in their hands.
                    I store all of my code on Github repositories. 
                    Mindustry even has a built in "Import From Github" feature.
                    You can use VSCode to open your repositories on Github.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Spriting</h4>
                <p>
                    I used to use Pixel Studio to create my sprites until I got linux on my chromebook.
                    I now use <a href="https://libresprite.github.io/#!/">Libresprite</a> which is a free fork of Aesprite. 
                    To download it I used <a href="https://flatpak.org/"> flatpak</a>.
